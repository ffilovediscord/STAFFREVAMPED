      <h2>How We Go</h2>
      <p>Be respectful and professional with everyone, whether itâ€™s fellow staff or community members. A good tone and friendly attitude go a long way in building trust and setting the right example.</p>
      <p>Keep things confidential. Never share private staff conversations, server logs, or sensitive user information outside the staff team. Confidentiality builds safety and respect.</p>
      <p>Steer clear of drama, arguments, or toxic behavior. We want a community where everyone feels welcome and safe. Let your conduct reflect the kind of space you want to be in.</p>
      <p>Remember, you are a role model. Your behavior directly impacts the serverâ€™s vibe, member retention, and overall atmosphere.</p>

      <h3>Dealing with Punishments</h3>
      <p><strong>Warnings:</strong> Use these when a rule is broken for the first time. Explain the rule clearly and give the user a chance to correct their behavior.</p>
      <p><strong>Mutes:</strong> Apply mutes when warnings are ignored, or for spam, mild harassment, or trolling. Keep it short-term unless behavior continues.</p>
      <p><strong>Kicks:</strong> Use kicks as a final escalation step for repeat issues or more serious offenses. Always provide a clear reason in the kick message.</p>
      <p><strong>Bans:</strong> Ban only when the user has committed serious offenses like hate speech, doxxing, or severe toxicity. Document it and notify senior staff.</p>
      <p>Always act calmly, fairly, and clearly. If unsure, always ask a senior team member before taking serious action like banning.</p>

      <h3>Handling Reports</h3>
      <p>Always respond quickly and respectfully to reports. Investigate carefully, gather solid evidence (screenshots, logs), and avoid acting on hearsay alone.</p>
      <p>Once resolved, update the reporter if appropriate, and keep all discussions within staff-only channels. Transparency within staff is important; confidentiality outside is critical.</p>

      <h3>What to Do Daily</h3>
      <p>Check on conversations across channels regularly to ensure things stay friendly and rule-abiding. Be helpful to new users and engage positively in chat.</p>
      <p>Stay active in staff discussions and participate in team decisions. Help monitor alerts from bots and keep an eye on audit logs.</p>

      <h3>Chatting with Staff</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>ðŸ’¬â”ƒstaff-chat â€“ for daily check-ins, coordination, and team help.</li>
        <li>ðŸ“¢â”ƒstaff-announcements â€“ for server updates and internal memos.</li>
        <li>ðŸŽ­â”ƒstaff-shitpost â€“ to relax, share memes, and keep morale up (without going overboard).</li>
      </ul>
