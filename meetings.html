      <h2>Staff Meetings</h2>
      <p>We host regular meetings to align on moderation standards, review any issues, and discuss ways to improve the server. These are important moments to make your voice heard, bring up suggestions, and learn about upcoming changes.</p>
      <p>Always come prepared by reviewing the agenda ahead of time if it's posted. Take notes if needed and ask questions if anything is unclear.</p>
